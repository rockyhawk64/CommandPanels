It’s not just a basic form builder, it’s a **live YAML editor** with structure checks and visual previews, helping you work faster and avoid YAML errors.

- ⚡ Visual layout builder with slot highlighting
- 🧹 Automatic indentation & structure checks

- 🧠 Supports complex panels, not just simple menus

## Real Logic & Real Data

CommandPanels lets you build menus that **react to players**, not just display static items.

- Inline `$AND`, `$OR`, `$NOT` operators and grouping
- Multiple items in a single slot with logical fallbacks
- **Persistent** or **session-based data** usable anywhere, even in other plugins via PlaceholderAPI

**Example Condition:**
~~~
conditions: "$NOT (%player_name% $EQUALS Steve) $AND %vault_eco_balance% $ATLEAST 5000"
~~~

This allows for **powerful, dynamic behavior** without scripting.
